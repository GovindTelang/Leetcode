/*letâ€™s take a specific example. Suppose we want to count how many numbers lie in the subtree rooted at 1 when n = 150.

We consider:

First = 1 (the smallest number starting with the prefix 1)
Last = 1 (the largest number starting with the prefix 1 that we can keep growing)
Now, we expand this range of numbers by multiplying the first and last by 10 at each step:

For First = 1, Last = 1, the numbers are 1 to 1 (just the number 1 itself).
Multiply by 10: First = 10, Last = 19, the numbers are 10 to 19 (all numbers from 10 to 19).
Multiply again: First = 100, Last = 199, the numbers would be 100 to 150, but since n = 150, we stop at 150. */
